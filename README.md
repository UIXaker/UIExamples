## Gallery Access Restricted

User-friendly Apple-style screen that provides a step-by-step explanation of how to enable full access to the photo library after user has previously restricted it. The screen includes an 'Open Settings' button that guides users to the specific app's permission settings. Each step is accompanied by rich and fully localizable previews that replicate the appearance of the iOS Settings app. This ensures a pixel-perfect UI and system colors.

There are some delightful details: a variable background blur overlay beneath the 'Open Settings' button, consistently positioned at the bottom, and background blur applied to the small circle button, in line with Apple's design principles found in its native apps.
