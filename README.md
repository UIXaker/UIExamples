# UI Examples

In this repository, you'll find a collection of small, reusable code snippets that you can freely use and integrate into your own projects. These tiny UI treasures have been carefully crafted, saving you time and effort in your development journey.

## Nice Button

iOS system-style button with scaling down, haptic feedback, and smoothly rounded corners that change in the pressed state. Developed using SwiftUI.

## Gallery Access Restricted View

User-friendly Apple-style screen that provides a step-by-step explanation of how to enable full access to the photo library after user has previously restricted it. The screen includes an 'Open Settings' button that guides users to the specific app's permission settings. Each step is accompanied by rich and fully localizable previews that replicate the appearance of the iOS Settings app. This ensures a pixel-perfect UI and system colors, with support for iOS 16 and iOS 17 (with its access differences). The modal also works in dark mode, written with pure Swift UI ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤Œ

There are some delightful details: a variable background blur overlay beneath the 'Open Settings' button, consistently positioned at the bottom, and background blur applied to the small circle button, in line with Apple's design principles found in its native apps.
